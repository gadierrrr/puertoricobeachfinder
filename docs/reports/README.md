# Reports (historical)

These Markdown files are historical snapshots of past work (contrast fixes, guide fixes, schema validation, deployment checklist).

Notes:
- Many reports refer to pre-`public/` migration paths like `assets/...`. The current on-disk location is typically `public/assets/...` (URL paths like `/assets/...` are unchanged).
- Treat these as reference-only; prefer current docs in `docs/` and the current codebase layout.
