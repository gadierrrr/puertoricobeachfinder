    [
        'question' => 'Can I visit a beach during a 4-hour layover in San Juan?',
        'answer' => 'Yes! Isla Verde Beach is only 5 minutes from San Juan Airport (SJU). For a 4-hour layover, you can realistically spend 90 minutes at the beach. Plan 30 minutes for immigration/customs, 10 minutes travel each way, 90 minutes beach time, and return 90 minutes before your next flight. Only attempt this if you have no checked bags and your layover is domestic or between terminals.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'What is the closest beach to San Juan Airport?',
        'answer' => 'Isla Verde Beach is the closest major beach to San Juan Airport (SJU), located just 2.5 km (1.5 miles) east of the terminal. The drive takes only 5-7 minutes via PR-26. You can see the beach from the plane when landing at SJU. It offers a wide sandy beach with chair rentals, restaurants, and water sports.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'Where can I store luggage near the airport?',
        'answer' => 'San Juan Airport (SJU) does not have official luggage storage inside the terminal. However, many hotels in Isla Verde (5 minutes away) offer luggage storage for non-guests for $5-10 per bag. ESJ Azul Hotel, Courtyard by Marriott, and Hampton Inn are near the beach and often accommodate this request. Call ahead to confirm. Some beach equipment rental shops also offer luggage storage.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'How much does a taxi cost from SJU to the beach?',
        'answer' => 'Taxi or Uber from San Juan Airport to Isla Verde Beach costs $8-12 (5 minutes). To Condado Beach: $15-20 (10 minutes). To Ocean Park: $18-25 (12 minutes). Uber is typically 20-30% cheaper than airport taxis. During peak hours (3-6 PM), expect higher surge pricing. For groups of 3-4, splitting a taxi is more economical than bus service.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'Is Isla Verde Beach close to the airport?',
        'answer' => 'Yes, Isla Verde Beach is extremely close to San Juan Airport - only 2.5 km (1.5 miles) or a 5-7 minute drive. It is the closest major beach to any international airport in the Caribbean. The beach runs parallel to the airport runway, and you can literally watch planes taking off and landing while swimming. This proximity makes it perfect for first-day arrivals or last-day departures.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'Can I rent beach equipment near the airport?',
        'answer' => 'Yes, Isla Verde Beach has numerous beach equipment rental stands along the shore. Expect to pay $15-20 for two chairs and an umbrella for the day, $25-35 for snorkel gear, $40-60 for kayak rentals, and $50-80 for paddleboard rentals. Many stands also offer boogie boards ($15-20) and beach toys. Some vendors accept credit cards, but cash (US dollars) gets better rates.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'What beach should I visit on my last day before flying out?',
        'answer' => 'Isla Verde Beach is ideal for last-day beach visits before your flight. Stay at the eastern end near the hotels for easy access to showers, bathrooms, and food. Plan to leave the beach 2.5-3 hours before your flight (international) or 1.5-2 hours (domestic). Many beachfront hotels allow non-guests to use outdoor showers. Keep beach gear minimal so you can pack wet items in a plastic bag in your carry-on.'
    ],
    [
        'question' => 'Are there showers and bathrooms near airport beaches?',
        'answer' => 'Yes, Balneario de Carolina (Isla Verde) has public bathrooms and outdoor showers as an official public beach facility. Many hotels along Isla Verde Beach also have outdoor showers accessible from the beach. Ocean Park and Condado have public facilities but they can be limited. For the cleanest facilities, consider stopping at a beachfront restaurant or hotel bar - most allow usage if you make a purchase.'

            <p><strong>San Juan Airport (SJU) is remarkably close to beautiful Caribbean beaches</strong> - in fact, Isla Verde Beach is only 5 minutes away. This makes it one of the most beach-accessible airports in the world, perfect for turning a layover into a mini beach vacation or maximizing your time on arrival or departure days.</p>

            <p>Whether you have a 4-hour layover, want to hit the beach before your evening flight, or are looking to make the most of your first or last day in Puerto Rico, the beaches near SJU Airport offer crystal-clear waters, golden sand, and convenient access. <strong>No need to sacrifice beach time to airport logistics.</strong></p>

            <p>This guide covers the 10 closest beaches to San Juan Airport, all within 15km (9 miles). We'll show you exactly how long it takes to reach each beach, what transportation options are available, where to store luggage, and how to plan layover beach visits of varying lengths.

                        Attempting a beach visit during a layover carries risk of missing your connection. Only attempt this if: (1) You have <strong>carry-on bags only</strong>, (2) Your layover is <strong>domestic or within the same terminal</strong>, (3) You're comfortable with tight timing, (4) Traffic is light (avoid weekday rush hours). <strong>We recommend 6+ hour layovers minimum</strong>. Always prioritize making your flight over beach time. Consider travel insurance for missed connections.
